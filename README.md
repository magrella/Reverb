# Electric Guitars Insights from Reverb.com

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a README file for extracting insights from electric guitar postings on Reverb.com. The goal of this project is to analyze the data and gain valuable insights into the electric guitar market.

## Course Description

The ability to build tools capable of retrieving and parsing information stored across the internet has become increasingly valuable in various fields of data science. This project is inspired by a course focused on web scraping, where we learn how to navigate and parse HTML code, and develop tools to automatically crawl websites.

The main technology used in this project is the Python library called scrapy. However, the techniques learned can be applied to other popular Python libraries as well, including BeautifulSoup and Selenium. By the end of the course, we will have a strong understanding of the HTML structure, be proficient in building tools to parse HTML code and access desired information, and create efficient scrapy spiders to crawl the web at scale.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to extract valuable insights from electric guitar postings on Reverb.com. By scraping the website, we can gather data on various aspects of electric guitars, such as brand, model, price, condition, and other relevant attributes. These insights can be used for market analysis, pricing trends, popularity rankings, and other data-driven research.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebook.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to analyze and extract insights from the scraped data. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and statistical analysis.
- `README.md`: This file you are currently reading provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use the notebook.
